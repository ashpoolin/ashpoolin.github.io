Hi. These pages are here to document my experiments hunting-and-pecking through crypto and the Solana runtime.
Learning at your expense, essentially. But I will try to make it worth your while. 

Background: I'm a EE who has built everything from large machinery, to aerospace sensors, to embedded systems.
I'm better with electrical power and electronics, tbh, but I've always been drawn to the command line. I bought my first bitcoin
in 2016, sold my first bitcoin in 2016. I mined ether and zcash in my apartment, eventually got my hands on some SHA-256 ASICs,
and went through all the different types of firmware you can flash onto them. I missed defi summer completely (as a btc maxi), but 
resolved to learn about it January 2021. I spent about a week with Ethereum, before downloading Solana CLI on a whim. And here I am. Thanks for dropping by.

-Ash
