## About

Salaryman / Solana weekend warrior. GPU mining Ether back in 2015, then bitcoin ASICs and wallets, until 2021 when I decided I "better learn about this defi stuff." I spent one month using Ethereum, then tried out the Solana CLI on a whim. Blown away by Solana, and I've been here ever since. This site for hosting my crazy ideas; no warranties express or implied. Not financial advice.
